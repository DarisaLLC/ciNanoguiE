Cinder port of Wenzel Jakob's NanoGui widget library.

see https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui for license details

if you want to run the demo as is you'll need to change the path to the icon images in line 113 of View.cpp

to use in your own Cinder projects:
-----------------------------------
-copy the "gui" folder into your project.
-create your own gui in View->create()
-create a ViewRef in your app and make the appropriate calls to it as in this NanoApp demo
